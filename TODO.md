# This is a full list of predicted features for CombustiblePotato.
Features will likely be implemented in order according to the below timeline. General quality of life and robustness fixes will be added periodically.

## Finish simulation
- Add arm non-pid simulation
- Add some type of intake simulation

## PID
- Drivetrain PID
- Arm PID

## Autonomous
- Basic demonstration of autonomous use within the bot

## LemonLib
- Rewrite used components of FRC's 5113 LemonLib respository for use in this program
- Auto controller detection and support for multiple types
- Provide simulation support for hardware that lacks it

## Vision and vision sim
- Photovision implementation using apriltags and pathplanner

## Full auton
- Full autonomous sequence to do *something*

## Integrate to something other than TimedRobot (?)
- This will only be implemented if deemed that TimedRobot cannot meet the expectations of our bot. If not, we will be sticking with this existing framework

## More to come if we decide to expand our Potato bot
